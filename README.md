## Regex Overview
### What is a Regex?

Regular expressions, often abbreviated as regex or regexp, are powerful tools for pattern matching and string manipulation. A regex is a sequence of characters that defines a search pattern. It's used for matching strings within a text based on specific rules, providing a flexible and efficient way to perform text processing tasks.

## Anchors
### ^ and $

Anchors such as ^ (caret) and $ (dollar sign) specify the start and end of a line, respectively. They help to ensure that a pattern is matched only at the beginning or end of a string.

## Character Classes
### [ ]

Square brackets [] define a character class, allowing you to match any one of a set of characters. For instance, [aeiou] matches any vowel.

## Quantifiers
### *, +, ?

Symbols like *, +, and ? specify the number of occurrences of the preceding character or group. For example, a* matches zero or more occurrences of the letter 'a'.

## Grouping
### ( )

Parentheses ( ) are used to group characters or expressions together. This is useful for applying quantifiers or other operations to a specific part of the pattern.

## Assertions
### \b, \B, (?=), (?!)

Learn about assertions and how they enable us to express conditions for a match without consuming characters. Understand word boundaries, positive and negative lookahead.

## Modifiers
### i, g, m

 Modifiers such as i (case-insensitive) and g (global) affect the matching behavior of the regex..

## Example Usage
### Applying the Regex

Text Search and Validation: Regex is commonly used for searching and validating text based on specific patterns, such as email addresses, phone numbers, or dates.

Text Extraction: It's used to extract specific information from strings, making it a valuable tool for data extraction and manipulation.

Text Editing: Regex is employed in text editors and programming languages for tasks like find and replace, making bulk changes to text.
